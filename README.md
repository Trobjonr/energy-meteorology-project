# Welcome, hello, and hi.
My project primarily focuses on comparing the results of Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) simulation wind profiles to in-situ data for the American Wake Experiment (AWAKEN) field campaign conducted in Oklahoma.

This repository will contain or reference all of the files necessary for the data analysis portion of my project.

Currently, the repository is split into several subdirectories:


/data: Raw and processed data. Due to the large size of the datasets, these will mostly be direct links to the original file hosts.

/docs: Additional documentation related to analysis, if needed. 

/results: Nice-looking figures, plots, graphs, etc of analyzed data. 

/scripts: All of the computer scripts needed for data processing and visualization. Essentially all written in Python.
